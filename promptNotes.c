Write a brief narrator heavy script for a D&D scene where 4 adventurers meet at a bar before setting off on a bounty hunting contract.


Dialog:

The camera pans across a crowded medieval tavern, filled with rowdy patrons and the smell of stale ale. Suddenly, it focuses on a table in the corner, where four adventurers have just arrived.

The first is a tall, muscular half-orc, with a scar running down his left cheek and a battle-axe slung over his shoulder. He wears a suit of chain mail, and a look of fierce determination on his face.

Next to him sits a slender elf, with a bow slung over her shoulder and a quiver of arrows at her side. She wears a green cloak and a hood pulled over her head, and her sharp eyes scan the room for potential threats.

Across from them sits a portly dwarf, with a bushy brown beard and a leather apron covering his sturdy frame. He carries a large hammer at his side, and his eyes sparkle with the promise of riches and adventure.

Last but not least is a human wizard, with a pointed hat and a long robe that trails across the floor. He carries a staff in one hand and a spellbook in the other, and his eyes flicker with the power of arcane magic.

As they settle into their seats, a grizzled old barkeep approaches them. "You folks lookin' for work?" he asks, eyeing their weapons and armor. "I got a line on a bounty, if you're interested."

The adventurers exchange a glance, their eyes gleaming with excitement. "Tell us more," the half-orc rumbles.

The barkeep leans in, his voice low and conspiratorial. "There's a band of goblins been raiding nearby villages, stealing food and livestock. The mayor's offered a reward for anyone who brings 'em in."

The dwarf grins, his eyes alight with greed. "How much we talkin'?"

The barkeep names a figure, and the adventurers nod in agreement. "We're in," the elf declares.

The camera fades to black as the four adventurers clink their mugs together, eager to set off on their next adventure.
